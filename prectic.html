    <P style="color: blueviolet;">We have been working for the help of students since 2017. With the passage of time, many senior students and teachers have joined our team to become the part of this noble cause. They provide us notes and helping material to share with public. As different persons are notes provider so there may be a chance of mistake in some notes. Although it happens rarely, but if you find some mistake in the helping material, you can report it at ustad360official@gmail.com.   </P>
